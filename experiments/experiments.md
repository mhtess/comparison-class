# Comparison class experiments

## Pilots

1. `pilot-1-paraphrase` (n=40; Summer 2016):
Wide range of adjective phrase stimuli.
Half of participants completed a open-ended paraphrase task using a "for a" paraphrase; the other half used "relative to".
2. `class-elicitation` (n=10; January 5, 2017):
More controlled set of adjective stimuli.
Free response paradigm using "for a".
Results indicated that just the most-specific subordinate category was used.
The task may have been too open-ended.
3. `class-elicitation-2` (n=18; January 7, 2017):
Cleaned up stimuli.
Subjects rate (using sliders) paraphrases of both a "subordinate" and "superordinate" paraphrase.
For example: "Luis sees a basketball player. Luis says, 'He is tall'."
What did Luis mean?
  - "Luis is tall relative to other basketball players."
  - "Luis is tall relative to other people." \\
Subjects can also give an "Other" option where they fill in a "relative to other" paraphrase.
