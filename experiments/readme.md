# Comparison class experiments

## Pilots

1. `pilot-1-paraphrase` (n=40; Summer 2016):
Wide range of adjective phrase stimuli.
Half of participants completed a open-ended paraphrase task using a "for a" paraphrase; the other half used "relative to".
2. `class-elicitation` (n=10; January 5, 2017):
More controlled set of adjective stimuli.
Free response paradigm using "for a".
Results indicated that just the most-specific subordinate category was used.
The task may have been too open-ended.
3. `class-elicitation-2` (n=18; January 7, 2017):
Cleaned up stimuli.
Subjects rate (using sliders) paraphrases of both a "subordinate" and "superordinate" paraphrase.
For example: "Luis sees a basketball player. Luis says, 'He is tall'."
What did Luis mean?
  - "Luis is tall relative to other basketball players."
  - "Luis is tall relative to other people." \\
Subjects can also give an "Other" option where they fill in a "relative to other" paraphrase.
4. `class-elicitation-2-items2` (n=9; January 9, 2017):
Same as previous but with refined stimuli.

## Planned experiments

1. `class-elicitation-2` and `class-elicitation-2afc`.
  - `class-elicitation-2` is very similar to the pilot. We are removing the "Other" option because it was not often used by participants in the pilot. The items have been subtly modified since the pilot.
  - `class-elicitation-2afc` is a 2-alternative forced-choice version of the experiment. we use this to provide convergent evidence and for ease of data analysis.

2. `vague-prior-elicitation-1` and `vague-prior-elicitation-2afc`
  - Again, these are slider bar and 2afc versions of the same task.
  - If they give convergent results, we will use the 2afc data for ease of data analysis
  - In these experiments, the participant knows the subordinate category ("Johns sees a basketball player"). Participants are asked if the adjective with an explicit superordinate comparison class would be appropriate (e.g., "How likely is it that the basketball player is tall relative to other people").
