# Comparison class experiments

## Pilots

1. `pilot-1-paraphrase` (n=40; Summer 2016):
Wide range of adjective phrase stimuli.
Half of participants completed a open-ended paraphrase task using a "for a" paraphrase; the other half used "relative to".
2. `class-elicitation` (n=10; January 5, 2017):
More controlled set of adjective stimuli.
Free response paradigm using "for a".
Results indicated that just the most-specific subordinate category was used.
The task may have been too open-ended.
3. `class-elicitation-2` (n=18; January 7, 2017):
Cleaned up stimuli.
Subjects rate (using sliders) paraphrases of both a "subordinate" and "superordinate" paraphrase.
For example: "Luis sees a basketball player. Luis says, 'He is tall'."
What did Luis mean?
  - "Luis is tall relative to other basketball players."
  - "Luis is tall relative to other people." \\
Subjects can also give an "Other" option where they fill in a "relative to other" paraphrase.
4. `class-elicitation-2-items2` (n=9; January 9, 2017):
Same as previous but with refined stimuli.

## Planned experiments

1. `class-elicitation-2` and `class-elicitation-2afc`.
  - `class-elicitation-2` is very similar to the pilot. We are removing the "Other" option because it was not often used by participants in the pilot. The items have been subtly modified since the pilot.
  - `class-elicitation-2afc` is a 2-alternative forced-choice version of the experiment. We run this first for ease of data analysis. (If it produces different results that what we expected from the pilot, we may run the slider version to see if this is due to the dependent measure.) Since each participant only does one-half of trials, we will collect about 150 participants to get approximately 75 responses for item. 75 responses on a 2AFC will produce confidence intervals with a maximum width of about 0.2-0.25. 

2. `vague-prior-elicitation-1` and `vague-prior-elicitation-2afc`
  - Again, these are slider bar and 2afc versions of the same task.
  - Same data collection plan as above.
  - In these experiments, the participant knows the subordinate category ("Johns sees a basketball player"). Participants are asked if the adjective with an explicit superordinate comparison class would be appropriate (e.g., "How likely is it that the basketball player is tall relative to other people").
