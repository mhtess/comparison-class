Notes from Noah, MH meeting on 5/26/17

## Plan of attack

[] Run free production version of 2AFC CogSci experiment
[] Analyze free production data.
  [] Can we detect shifts in the freely-elicited distribution based on the factors of our model?
  [] Are there multiple reasonable comparison classes? If so, create 2 (or 3?) AFC version of the task, using the modal produced comparison classes?
[] Do model comparison to L0 version to test the importance of informativity?
